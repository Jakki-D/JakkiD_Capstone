                <p> I was born and raised around water on a little island on the Northern tip of Vancouver Island. This island is called Alert Bay or Cormorant Island. It is the tradtional territories of the Namgis poeple, who call this Island Yalis. It is on this island that my love for water started. I would spend a lot of my time at the beach playing with friends and family. We would have picinics, go swimming, collect crabs and prepare our tradtional bbq fish. </p>
                <p>This small community was a fishing community that had many boats and fleets from all over come to our island especailly during the summer. This was harevesting time. Where we would gather our tradtional foods from our waters. Salmon, halibut, prawns and crab have always been my favorite foods.  </p>
