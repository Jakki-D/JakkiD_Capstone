                <p> Water, a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless and odourless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances. Indeed, the versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms. Life is believed to have originated in the aqueous solutions of the worldâ€™s oceans, and living organisms depend on aqueous solutions, such as blood and digestive juices, for biological processes. Water also exists on other planets and moons both within and beyond the solar system. In small quantities water appears colourless, but water actually has an intrinsic blue colour caused by slight absorption of light at red wavelengths. </p>

                <h1>Why water is important to me</h1>
                <p> I was born and raised around water on a little island on the Northern tip of Vancouver Island. This island is called Alert Bay or Cormorant Island. It is the tradtional territories of the <a href="https://namgis.bc.ca/" target="_blank">'Namgis people</a>, who call this Island Yalis. It is on this island that my love for water started. I would spend a lot of my time at the beach playing with friends and family. We would have picinics, go swimming, collect crabs and prepare our tradtional bbq fish. </p>
                <p>This small community was a fishing community that had many boats and fleets from all over come to our island especailly during the summer. This was harevesting time. Where we would gather our tradtional foods from our waters. Salmon, halibut, prawns and crab have always been my favorite foods. </p>
